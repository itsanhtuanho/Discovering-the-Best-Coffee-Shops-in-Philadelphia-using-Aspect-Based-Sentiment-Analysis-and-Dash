3,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"Really awesome place, coffee was delicious and the bagel was perfect. Love the message and the intent. Only issue was they don't call out drinks?

4,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"Walked over, asked for a bagel toasted with cream cheese. Got home. Changed back into sweat pants to watch the game only to find out they didn't toast my bagel. Could I have easily toasted it at home? Yes. Ah not this time! due to 4 lbs of cream cheese they irresponsibly slathered in every nook and cranny of the bagel. So even if I could find my largest mixing bowl to hold all the cream cheese it still would have been a lousy toasted bagel. I feel bamboozled out of my Sunday bagel. I'm not mad. Just disappointed.",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,2.0
5,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"I come here often to work on my dissertation. I like the vibe, they play mostly old school Black American music, some early 2000s soul, and some traditional/folk music. 

The set up is very bohemian. I would describe it as Erykah Badu vibes lol. The coffee is good, and all of the menu items are named after Black people throughout history, which I love. 

It's usually a good work environment, so I'd definitely recommend this spot for my fellow students and/or entrepreneurs. 

Baristas are always nice!

The only reason I docked a star is because I'm a bit of a neat freak and this space could definitely use a good sweep. If I could do a half a star then I would give them 4.5, but I can't.",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,4.0

8,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,Order was an hour late. I ordered a side of chips and it's a bunch of crumbs that someone threw in the bottom of the bag. Workers are rude.

9,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"I came here because I learned about Franny Lous on Yelps feature of black owned businesses in the area. It's about just over a mile north from me so it wasn't in my ~normal~ radius of searching for restaurants. BUT, the food and drinks will keep me coming back. 

Ordered the Dorothy Day speciality latte (if I remember the name correctly) and their Pro-Community vegan hummus sandwich. 

The latte was delicious. Vegan milk options and had the right flavor without being too sweet. 

The sandwich was the right portion for a lighter breakfast and the ingredients were both fresh and tasty. The bread was beautifully toasted - looked like an artistic masterpiece and the crunch of the bread paired well with the softness of the hummus. 

The prices were higher than advertised online so just know as FYI and in general it felt slightly high compared to other coffee shops. That said, I wouldn't make this my weekly go-to but it'll definitely be a treat myself kind of place.",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,5.0

12,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"Poor containers. It's the second time I've come here for coffee and the cup is broken. Months apart! By the time I'm about 3 block away, the bottom of the cup starts dripping. This is ridiculous. Shame on me for coming back after the first time this happened. The first time the seam wasn't properly waxed or something.

Please check the coffee cups or change suppliers. You're buying faulty  paper products!

So, after two bad experiences, this review was still in drafts. My uncle was visiting and during his wondering around he found this place and dragged me to it. Changed my opinion of it a little since their bagels are good and it's a different experience to get the coffee in a mug and not a this-cup-is-gonna-fall-apart. The barista was high or something. Like, couldn't keep her eyes open, kept asking what our order was and was more interested in talking to some dude than giving back correct change.",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,2.0
13,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"I had a really good experience here. It's such a hip little cafe without reading pretentious, and the barista helped me pick out my food and tea. I love the way the tea is prepared and the sandwich I had was very good. It's a really casual atmosphere with plenty of space and wasn't overly packed when I was there. I just enjoyed my time in the space and can't wait to go back.",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,5.0
14,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"Was looking for some chill cafes in the local neighborhood and found this one on Yelp. I just really wanted to get away and without access to a car, this was a short 7 min walk. I love that it's Black Woman owned- it's fantastic. Such a warm, chill vibe when you walk in. Everyone is minding their own business- lots of people on their computers plugging away. 

I had the Gil Heron Scott latte which was great! I'm usually a Chai Tea Latte drinker but this was a little different with some chocolate flavor. I would have liked for it to be a little hotter but perhaps next time I will ask for extra hot :) I also had the cheese danish. 

They have this cool section - like a library only you don't take the books home- where you could pick up anything and read it. A nice departure from staring at my phone. Would love to come back and try another tea and perhaps a different food item!",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,4.0
15,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"I don't usually like breakfast sandwiches but I'm a big fan of the Pro-Love sandwich! The bread is crunchy yet has enough give and the wrapping holds it all together. The grilled onions and spinach go perfectly with the cheese and sausage and helps to balance out the flavor. If you're looking for something sweet, check out their blueberry muffins! Haven't tried their drinks yet as I've been making coffee at home but I've heard great things.

If you're in the area, definitely try them out. Not only are you getting great food but you're also supporting a local business with a mission and intent as shown by their menu.

20,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"The food and service were alright but how can an overpriced bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich be ""anti-capitalist""? Were the profits made on the sale of the sandwich redistributed to the workers who put their labor into making it? Wouldn't an anti-capitalist sandwich be more affordable to the working class rather than a gourmet product for the petite bourgeoisie? Can any consumable good sold on the free market ever really be considered anti-capitalist in the first place?",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,3.0
21,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"Definitely important to support local spots, especially black-owned and ones involved with their community.

22,_O_KBH1MStcUkS1xk5pxsg,Franny Lou's Porch,"I love this cafe! I was staying at an Airbnb in the area and this cafe came recommended by our host. It is an eclectic cafe with many historical and empowering messages! 

I loved their homemade pastries-- I tried the cornbread cookie and blueberry muffin. They were both delicious! I also loved the chunky veggie cream cheese. The lattes were very unique with unique names to match.

My couple constructive comments-- some other reviews have mentioned this, but nothing was ever announced when our food was up. We were at the back of the cafe and finally went to check and everything was just sitting there. Some clarity would be nice! Also, there was some confusion with bagel orders. They told me i got the last everything bagel and then let my friend order an everything bagel next. When her food didn't come up they told her someone else took it (which I'm assuming was me?) even though that wasn't the case. All in all it got resolved but definitely a little miscommunication.

Breakfast sandwiches were awesome, I got their specialty latte the ""Cesar Chavez"" and it was AMAZING (I'm usually not a flavored latte kinda person, but because of the name & flavor combo I had to try it and I wasn't disappointed). They have an efficient system of ordering & picking up while allowing for social distancing. There are some chairs out for customers to sit at, but no tables.

Went inside the coffee shop and everyone was really nice and friendly (all employees wore mask). When I stopped by, people were eating outside and I was the only one eating inside at the time (felt super comfortable, special, and I liked the decor/vibe).

Ordered the James Baldwin latte (with no cinnamon) on the rocks. Quality coffee! Ate the very fulfilling pro-love sandwich: organic turkey sausage, smoked colby, baked eggs, grilled onions, and fresh greens. Fresh & tasty! Watched Manifest on Netflix on my phone while indulging in my morning breakfast =). Happiness!

I would've stopped by Franny Lou's Porch sooner but thought they opened up at 10am. Currently on Google, it states the coffee shop opens at 8am-4pm everyday! Will be back!",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,5.0

Franny Lou's is the cutest community coffee shop that offers a wide range of creative lattes, cafe drinks, and some delicious breakfast bites. What stands out is their interest in serving the community -- they attach a tiny flyer with your food order with positive quotes and happenings!

I tried 2 lattes, both named after positive historical figures and also really delicious. I only got to try the almond croissant but it definitely hit the spot!

There were a lot of creative options (including an apple butter mocha latte, which my partner got) and with names like ""Pro Community"" and ""Anti Capitalism,"" you know their values immediately. They are dedicated to sustainabilty and fostering connection with the Earth, which is awesome. 

I got the oat milk latte and a croissant, both of which were delicious. The drinks came out in mason jars with crochet coozies, and I found this to be a lovely touch (and in line with their value of sustainability)! My partner got the Anti Capitalism sandwich, and it was incredible! Egg, cheese, greens on focaccia bread. It took a lot of self control not to order one to go!

They also offer locally made goods, such as mugs, ancestral healing cream, and more. With both indoor and outdoor seating, this is the perfect place to grab a snack and a cuppa!",0.7392207818726698,0.8055555555555556,4.5,5.0

Loved the creative names for the menu items. The coffee was perfect. A bit pricey but I guess it's expected since businesses have suffered during this pandemic. 

I had the Anne Shimojima and it was perfect. Not overly sweet or bitter, just rite. I also had the bacon, egg, with greens sandwich and it was good and filling. My co-worker ordered a muffin with butter and was charged $1.50 for butter which caught him off guard but he did say the muffin was fresh and good and loved the coffee.

38,bpEiVcivZFHixcDGKXQQJA,Valerio Coffee Roasters,"I skipped breakfast in anticipation of eating a decent brunch at Valerio. Bad idea. Ordered the quiche at 12:45 PM and was told that even though they had just run out, they would have another ready to serve in 1 hour tops. I waited until 2:15 PM until I walked up to the counter to politely inquire about the status of my quiche, as I was starving. Got a cold look and a ""Actually, it'll be 45 more minutes because we still have to cool it."" Fine. Waited until 3. Still nothing. 
The weirdest part was that they had ALREADY charged my card for the quiche. Before I could ask for a refund so I could purchase something else, she rudely snapped ""you can keep coming up to the counter if it makes you feel better, but I just can't cut the quiche right now."" I was so shocked that I just said okay, honestly was a little frightened off. When it was finally made (2.5 hours later), it was essentially 4 bites of a veggie omelet with no crust. It would've been nice to hear a ""sorry about the extended wait"" instead of getting attitude. 
It's totally fine if it takes you 2-3 hours to make that. Just don't lie to your customers in order to get them to buy things. And don't be insanely rude about it?

42,bpEiVcivZFHixcDGKXQQJA,Valerio Coffee Roasters,"My introduction to Valerio Coffee Roasters came from using the surplus food app. This is one of the few businesses that impressed me all around. The area is a little hard to manage when it comes to parking but I lucked out today. This is a place worth working to find a spot. The staff is super helpful to everyone that enters. I didn't get the impression they were offering me any special treatment the staff was just two energetic people working in the service industry.

As for ambiance, Outside they have a few two seat bistro style tables away from the curb. You wouldn't feel like you were in danger. Inside the decor is modern like a semi-bohemian coffee shop. The current seating is spaced out but enough for 3-4 parties of 4 during Covid. It's crisp and clean.  At the time a few people were on laptops sipping tea or coffee.

As for the experience, the staff was friendly, upbeat and informative about the products. We had tasty chicken salad and croissants with a delicious and fragrant tea I believed it was hibiscus and ??? I just know it was good!

43,bpEiVcivZFHixcDGKXQQJA,Valerio Coffee Roasters,"I used to go here often, before and after COVID. They've been hit or miss over time but during COVID it's just been complete misses. Last time I went and I waited 10 minutes for a black iced coffee with an aftertaste of vodka. You'd think that time spent waiting was because of the volume of orders they had. 

You'd be wrong. They had two other people there waiting for orders.

All of their coffees & drinks are great! I tried the lattes, matcha latte, cold brew coffee (very smooth) & Siphon coffee - pricey but well worth it. Rare to find a place with Siphon coffee gear from Japan & I am happy to be supporting a small minority-owned business.

I also LOVE their Rasberry Oat bar. They hv a delectable selection of breakfast muffins, cake slices, cookies etc.

Meals - I tried their dumpling sampler. Awesome choice and love the homemade chili oil.

The Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup was SO worth it. Again a bit on the pricey side I know BUT try it at least once! (And then come back for more..) The soup is sooooo flavorful, the noodles smooth and soft but not soggy, plentiful veggies and the beef slices melt in your mouth. It's also a good size bowl so I definitely had leftovers.

We ordered the sweet tea before leaving to go to a bubble tea shop across the street since that was what we originally had wanted.

First, was the dumpling sampler. Now, admittedly they were lukewarm, but that didn't stop the skin from being too thick to my liking and I just didn't care for the fillings.

I thought the beef noodle soup was the best of the lot. I don't usually care for beef stock, but this was very good. The only thing is I would have chosen the option of getting the noodles on the side and added them to the pot when I was reheating the broth and that was hot.

By far, the worst was the young chow fried rice. It was absolutely tasteless. There seemed to be no seasoning at all.

The food: 
Ordered a Japanese siphon coffee and a dirty chai latte. The coffee wasn't spectacular but it was good and really cool to watch it be made. For $8-$12 for siphon coffee, you're paying for that experience. Dirty chai was good. Both came with small pastries which were nice and all presented well. I wish they had better pastry options, or just more. It's a coffee and tea shop, something sweet to eat with those would be great. What they did have (cake slices) looked like it had been sitting there for days. We were overall enjoying the concept and thought it was such a neat place until...
The experience:
The shop is very small and there were two workers there with very soft music playing so we could hear everything they were saying and also felt like we couldn't talk about the drinks or they'd hear everything we were saying. We got our drinks and they started chatting with each other. The male was irate at a bad yelp review they had gotten because of their bathrooms. Awkward to be customers listening to the workers complaining about a yelp review but it was so much worse than that. He was so pissed about this guy and kept going on and on for the entirety of our stay there. He said some things that were pretty obscene.

Their menu includes a variety of exotic coffees and teas that you won't find elsewhere. The food here is incredibly fresh and tastes less salty than other Chinese food I've had, which I like.

The last time I was here, I ordered wonton soup, the dumpling sampler, and shrimp fried rice. We shared the last two things. The fried rice is among my favorite ever and has a taste and texture unlike anything else. You might think, ""It's just fried rice,"" but I can assure you it isn't.

142,Q9poenJ9SS3agpPo4Pgyyg,Ray's Café & Teahouse,"This is one of my new favorite gems in Philly. (Warning: love letter ahead)

It's a cozy space so when we went for breakfast on a Saturday morning all the tables were taken - we were prepared to wait, but they cleared off a table just so we could sit right away!! (At this point, my heart was already full.)

I had never had siphon coffee before, so the owner's son (we never got his name but with my creepy detective skills, I think his name is Lawrence) told us all about how the process works while we watched him brew it right in front of us (it looks like a chemistry experiment!). I got the sumiyaki and my friend got the Jamaican blue coffee and Lawrence gave us the extras from both so that we could try each other's. Looking at the coffee, you can tell it's going to be the smoothest coffee you've ever had. I'm not even a regular coffee drinker, and when I do I usually have a latte, but I was able to drink the siphon coffee black (probably because it was also accompanied by a cute little chocolate-dipped shortbread cookie that is from the same Greek place they've been getting them from for the last 30 years). It's pricey but well worth it!

We also ordered the beef tomato rice which was like tomato egg rice (the ultimate classic Chinese comfort food) with corn/peas/carrots, beef, and ketchup. So so cozy. We also got the popular dumpling sampler; they were all plump and juicy and everything I wanted.

There was delicious homemade chili oil as well, which is a labor of love by Lawrence's brother who grinds the peppers himself and has to arm himself with goggles/gloves when he makes it. You can take some home for about $4 a container - do it and thank me later.

My friend and I were enjoying our morning slowly so by the end of the meal we had talked to Lawrence quite a bit. After we got the check he even gave us a slice of the cheesecake (I LOVE cheesecake so to say I was excited is an understatement) which was accompanied by coffee jelly and espresso beans. The cheesecake was smooth, creamy, and not too sweet. It was made by his brother who came up with a recipe from lots of Youtube research and taste testing by a friend who is also a cheesecake aficionado. 

The hospitality I experienced here reminded me of why I love Philly so much, and you can see how much pride the Ray family has in their cafe and how much care and intentionality was involved in the food/drinks from beginning to end (even in selecting the dishes/utensils). I hope it stays around for many many more years to come, and next time I'm in town it'll be my first stop!",0.7696650345274743,0.8297872340425532,4.5,5.0

Known as the America's oldest candy store, visit to this store is a must in Philadelphia. As old as this place is, you would see a lot of old things kept in the store. One of my favorite thing in the store was the old billing machine. 
They have a variety of candies but they are best known for their toy candies. More than their candies I really liked their hot chocolate which is sold at the back of the store. 
I am also told that they also give store tours which can be booked in advance. Visiting this store is more about visiting a piece of history than visiting a candies store.",0.8223251617232035,0.9302325581395348,4.5,4.0
146,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"This is a place after my heart. I love chocolate anything and everything. Here, they specialize in bean-to-bar truffles, chocolates, and hot chocolate. The flavor profiles of their dark chocolate options are varied and rich. And they don't stop there! They have an extensive selection of colorful candies, caramels, and fudge. And they are all displayed in an old-fashioned candy shop. The place dates back to 1863 and has maintained its historic candy and chocolate-making traditions ever since. You can feel the history as you step in, walking on the old, wooden floors, enjoying the pastel colors of the walls, and colorful displays of the candy. Everything is delightful. I tried the lemon lavender fudge and fell in love a bit more. I procured a couple bean-to-bar truffles with cinnamon and the other in the shape of the Liberty Bell. Both disappeared quickly (how mysterious!) and were quite delicious. 

Further inside, you can order hot chocolate and also watch people making new candy/chocolates. I tried a flight of the House Drinking Chocolate (which ended up being my favorite since it was rich & thicker than the rest), the Agua De Nicaragua (also quite nice with cinnamon notes), and the Tuscan Jasmine Cioccolato (which only took on notes of the orange towards the bottom).

Drinking chocolates made to order. The varieties change occasionally but they're always good. 4oz is $5. While it seems small, it's just the right amount.

The shop is split into two parts: the entrance is a retail store with chocolate and candies to go, and the back is a small café with hot chocolate and small nibbles to enjoy inside. The decorations in the café were a smidge over the top - I felt they were trying too hard to be old timey and retro. But the experience was fun nonetheless. And the hot chocolate and the mini chocolate bar I ordered hit the spot.

149,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"5 stars for basically everything inside this store. Like the Franklin Fountain, you can't beat the fancy interior and the old timey and genuine feel. I've been to similar stores in New England and on the west coast and this one beats em all (gotta keep the mom and wife's sweet teeth satisfied with chocolate year round). I don't think I got to experience everything they have to offer but it looks like they make customized chocolates there in front of you. The store associates dress the part, too. You know what else? Free samples. You at least have to go in for that and watch the chocolate get made. Hard to say no to free chocolate coming from the kitchen.

I bought a small box of 10 chocolates--I got to choose them all--and got bags of dark chocolate covered espresso beans, dark chocolate covered almonds, dark chocolate malt balls(?) (like the whoppers candy), and cayenne chocolate. Chocolate made in house is always so super rich and good. Chocolate is 5 stars. 

I was there strictly for chocolate so I didn't spend much time looking at the other sugary delights. They've got chocolate covered pretzels and everything comes in milk or dark chocolate: caramel, lavender(!), nuts, cream, etc. They've got holiday themed candies and chocolate, for example, for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, etc. Supposedly it's the only store around that sells gelt. 

Ordering is a little confusing and the prices are higher than average but you get what you pay for. The store associate was nice in labeling all the chocolates in the box for me so I wouldn't forget what each one was.

I was looking for a place that would do the whole shabang with whip cream, chocolate shavings, marshmallows, maybe a little chocolate wafer. So I come across Shane's and they have great reviews on their hot chocolate. My boyfriend and I venture down to Shane's one Saturday evening for this awesome hot chocolate. We couldn't find parking so I walk in by myself while the bf does laps. This place was super cute but the one thing that immediately turned me off was the staff. They were dressed all colonial (very cute) but they seemed overworked and unhappy. There was one girl at the hot chocolate shop taking orders AND making these handcrafted hot chocolates which took incredibly long. I felt so bad for this poor girl that I almost left. This place needed to be better staffed on a Saturday night. I just wasn't getting good vibes from this place and the whole experience was unpleasant. I don't care how good the hot chocolate was (it was good, but rich so get a small!), the hospitality just wasn't there. Hospitality has such an impact on my experiences at restaurants and stores. That's why I dig Trader Joe's. Anyways, I'm not trying to totally bash Shane's but I did want to comment on this because it kinda made me not want to come back.

What made me come here? My aunt received a hand pressed gingerbread cookie from her daughter-in-law. It came from this very store!! The cookie looked so historical... So elegant... So very wonderful! I absolutely had to come to the store after seeing the lady cookie! I thought it was such a charming precious cookie!
I am crazy about cookies, and I must say that the lady cookie my aunt was given was just so special looking! So I came.
I asked the staff when I entered about the cookie... Where they were. I really thought that there would be a bin of freshly made cookies. But the girl at the front said the cookies were only at Christmas only. When I got to the back area by the hot chocolate and chocolate bars, I saw a small basket with some of these amazing pressed ginger cookies! I didn't have the LADY cookie but they have other beautifully hand pressed cookies. SO MY MISSION WAS COMPLETE! 

It didn't end there! I saw the Jefferson drinking chocolate for $5 and a marshmallow (handmade) for $ .50 
Do stop by and have a hot cup of Drinking Chocolate! And a handmade marshmallow!! Step out of the cold and warm up!! 
**The most amazing souvenir おみやげ you can get is a hand pressed gingerbread cookie. So elegant !! So flavorful!! 

What a uniquely precious time spent at Shane Confectionery. 
Handmade candies and chocolates. 
I bought some chocolate covered pretzels! It just seems like such a typical Philadelphia TREAT to experience &taste &saver &relish!

*Nostalgic valentines from long ago!! I'm so smitten for this place!! They also sold for one dollar vinegar valentines for those whose heart has been broken! That was good for a chuckle!

-i'm really hoping my valentine buys a heart filled with Shane's chocolate. (Said with my hand clutching my shirt! Everything looks so special and so romantic! It's LADIES chocolate!) 

*They also saw a beautiful handmade stationary made from pressed flowers. Four dollars. I bought a bunch a Them! It is absolutely gorgeous!
**Honestly speaking, the staff certainly was not as welcoming as everything else in the store was so preciously pleasant. The staff was dressed in period Clothing. This looked so wonderful. There were 2 girls in the front and one girl back by the cocoa and a fella with a beard. You hoped for a smile... it wasn't so busy. Surly. Not one crack of a smile. Perhaps years of living in Japan and experiencing cheerful service has spoiled  me?

I think I'm still buzzing from the hot cocoa from the cafe. It was super rich and creamy. Seriously, the most luscious hot chocolate I have ever drank. They had free samples of different chocolates available at the entrance to the cafe. 

The store is gorgeous!  It smells magnificent. I love the details they've put into maintaining the store, right down to the old fashion cash register that requires you to pull a lever. 

We had the lemon and raspberry white chocolate confections (superb, lemon being our favorite). They also had thick candy sticks shaped as candy canes (very intense flavors for the lemon and cherry candy canes).

159,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"This old time candy shop is every bit as cute 'n kitschy as everyone says.  With a sweet staff to match.  It wasn't a 'must-visit' on my obsessively culled Philly food stop list, but am glad we ultimately wound up here:

So yeah...  Hubby was a big fan of the thick, rich (too rich for moi) Hot Chocolate he treated himself to at the little cafe in the back of this shop. ""It's made with 72% dark chocolate, with no added sugar!"" he raved.  ""It tastes just as good as the one from Jacques Torres,"" he elaborated, referring to his favorite NYC spot for Hot Chocolate.  

As he is prone to do, hubby had a friendly chat with the barista (or is it cocoarista?) while he was waiting for his drink.  She apparently described a Cocoa Nib Tea they offer, made from yes, you guessed it, ground Cocoa Nibs steeped in hot water.  

Meanwhile, the kid picked out some Rock Candy on a stick, while nothing really jumped out at Mama.  But since I sure as hell wasn't about to turn down the chance to snag some posh sweets, I went with a Lavender Caramel and a Thai Peanut Butter, both dark chocolate-covered.  Wound up trying them a few days later back in BK, and could not, for the life of me, remember what I chose.  Amazingly, as soon as I bit into each of them, I knew, simply based on how true they both tasted. Am all about robust, but well-balanced flavor and these chocolates really brought it.

Bottom line:  If you're in it for the 150 plus years history of this place, then a visit may well be worth your while.  If your main goal is chocolate 'n candy, however, you may be a bit underwhelmed by the selection, as I was.  I think I had some silly, unrealistic Willy Wonka-like expectations, though.

So hubby & I were in Philly last weekend. We haven't been there in over a decade, but after discovering only a few weeks ago that now since we moved, we're a stone's throw from Philly. While making plans, a friend told us about Shane's. He thought it would be our thing. Well, it will have to be our new pilgrimage spot. For the drinking chocolate alone. Then there's the fudge and the caramels and the CBD chocolate that would make Willy Wonka blush. 

There is no place in the US that I've been to that serves drinking chocolate. I stumbled upon this while in Paris' cafe Angelina on the Rue de Rivoli. I tried making it myself, unsuccessfully at the time, and since I wasn't going back to Paris anytime soon, I put the idea of drinking chocolate from my mind. Until Shane's and the drinking chocolate bar at the rear of the store-- which is an incredible, old-fashioned, candy shop replete with marble counters, candies of every color, and copper kettles in the back kitchens. The decor reminded me of an old apothecary with glass cabinets, jars, and gorgeous stained glass. Heading to the rear of the shop you'll find the chocolate bar and a quaint little cafe table, replete with chairs that I fancy have been there since the turn of the last century. 

Hubby got the 8 ounce of Jefferson's blend, while I embarked on the trio of 4 ounce tastings, choosing Jefferson's, the Tuscan (smacking of citrus and jasmine), and I think it was a Spanish blend with cinnamon, chili and a hint of cardamom. 

Then there's the fudge....and the caramels.... and the chocolate truffles. Never before have I had chocolate and been satisfied with just a piece or two. Can't wait to go back & don't try the Lemon Lavender fudge so there's more for me. :)",0.8223251617232035,0.9302325581395348,4.5,5.0

165,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"As a chocolate connoisseur, it's no surprise I stumble (*ahem* seek out) all things chocolate. So let me tell you about the best hot chocolate I've come to find.

If you love the whole ""old fashioned ice cream parlor"" scene and you're from the South Jersey area, you are probably pretty familiar with a place called Franklin Fountain. It's an ice cream & soda shop that catapults you to the past but gives you amazing ice cream from today in Old City (Philly). Next door is their sister shop, a chocolate shop nonetheless, called Shane's Confectionary.

My husband and I actually stumbled upon Shane's when we found an event for their location (A Cookie and Milk Tasting!).  The tasting itself was rather odd, but being inside their facility was a pretty cool adventure. This is when we stumbled upon their hot chocolate. The ""chocolate café"" Is tucked in the back of Shane's Confectionery, past all the delicious looking chocolates. If you blink, you'd miss it.

You can do a shared tasting, which my husband and I like to do. It costs $5 per 4 oz pour. Their typical menu consists of:

-Thomas Jefferson's Drinking Chocolate (rich and sweet)

-House Drinking Chocolate (blend of house made chocolates)

-Agua de Nicaragua (Coconut Milk, Cinnamon)

-Royal Spanish Drinking Chocolate (Cinnamon, Chili Pepper)

- Tuscan Jasmine Cloccoiato (Jasmine Petals, Orange Zest)

- White Peppermint (White Chocolate, Cream, Peppermint)

At the time of our visit (December) they had the following seasonal flavor:

-Spiced Apple Drinking Chocolate (Caramelized White Chocolate with Apples and Gingerbread Spice)

They also offer Brewed Cocoa Tea and London Coffeehouse Cocoa Brew.

You can also add house made marshmallows, among other toppings.

On our visit we ordered the Thomas Jefferson, the Royal Spanish Drinking Chocolate, and the White Peppermint.


The Thomas Jefferson was the darkest item in the photograph, but I found it to be milky rich, not dark (which I enjoyed). It was the perfect temperature and texture (medium thickness). The Royal Spanish is always my favorite one to get, but I definitely could not drink a lot of that one. It is has the right amount of spicy and sweet and was also the perfect temperature. The White Peppermint was a new one for me this year. It was rather thin compared to the other two items. It was scolding hot for quite a while. Even the cup it was in was burning hot. The peppermint flavor was sweet and not overpowering.

All items are made from melting chocolate and adding the milk and proper spices. They melt the items in pans right in front of you. It is a really cool thing to watch and enjoy.

It makes the perfect date! I  highly recommend you give this place a visit, especially if you like hot cocoa. It's the perfect mixture of sweet, savory, warmth, and history.",0.8223251617232035,0.9302325581395348,4.5,5.0

Save some souvenir money for this place. They have an assortment of delicious chocolate-y treats, including 'Liberty Bells' and hand spun milkshakes in the back. The vintage register and workers in old fashioned uniforms add to the charm of the place. I can't recommend this place enough. There's something for everyone! I still check their site to drool over the treats. In the spring of '19, I stumbled upon their custom Easter bunny on a motorcycle chocolate and ordered one for my bike-loving guy. It was a huge hit! I added some melt away candies for myself. Both arrived (many states away) in perfect shape and tasted just as good as the treats did in Philly.

I love that the confectionery has such an old-fashioned ambiance and it doesn't hurt that the chocolates are delicious! It's a pretty small store so it can get crowded pretty easily, especially when there are a lot of little kids running around. When it's empty, it's an amazing place to spend a few minutes just browsing. I highly recommend getting at least one piece of chocolate on your way out!",0.8223251617232035,0.9302325581395348,4.5,5.0

177,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"CBD dark chocolate bars?! Um, yes please!! 

When I shop for gifts, especially for folks outside of PA, I prefer to buy local and PA things. So naturally come holiday shopping time, I decided to go to Shane Confectionery. My day started a bit rough but that was my fault for not checking new protocols before going over there. The shop doesn't open until noon and right now, it's only curbside pick-up or shop at the door with a printed menu, fyi. 

I planned to get some gummy bears, and their dark and milk chocolate bars BUT when I got there, something else caught my attention - CBD chocolate bars, which aren't sold on their website btw. So much like everything else in 2020, I pivoted. The CBD chocolate bars are available only dark so I ended up buying several of those in addition to milk chocolate bars and their gummy bears. 

They're not cheap but definitely worth it. Besides, they're also a historic Philadelphia landmark so why not support them? I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I am semi-safe from them but not going to lie...I do think about those CBD chocolate bars pretty often.

Be warned it's not the typical hot cocoa found in some box mixed that is extremely sweet and flavorless. This this the thick and rich stuff you expect to sip on a cold day. The Spanish Royal was my favorite. The hint of cinnamon and chili had the perfect combination to cure chocolate craving.

Due to the holiday this weekend, they were super busy. I saw an army of orders they were fulfilling in their tiny little space. Regardless of how busy they are, the staff are always super patient and friendly. 

They were out of one of the things I went for but the employee patiently helped me pick out a replacement. Seriously...if you're ever nearby or even if you're not, shop their wonderful goodies.

181,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"Wow!! This place is something that everyone should check out if they are in the area. Shane Confectionery has been making chocolate for over 100 years. They really take you back to old times with the original woodwork and clothing. 

My friend and I talked with the workers for a while about the chocolates. They were so nice and were happy to explain everything. 

Everything was pricer but for a good reason! They still make chocolate the same way they originally did over a century ago!! 

I was intrigued by the drinks. After talking over the menu, I decided to get the chocolate tea. I watched as she ground cocoa nibs on a big stone. Then she steeped the ground cocoa nibs in some hot water. Finally she poured me a little glass of heaven! 

This tea was fantastic! It tasted exactly how you would imagine. It had the nice earthy chocolate taste but it was not sweet which I loved! 

If I'm ever back in philly I will for sure come back here and try some of their chocolates!",0.8223251617232035,0.9302325581395348,4.5,5.0
182,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"Does Shanes have the best hot chocolate in Philadelphia? In short, yes. At $9 a cup, if you opt for an enormous cube of home-made marshmallow (and why wouldn't you?), it is a decadent, must-try luxury. But also absolutely guilt free because not only is it so good, the cups and lids are compostable!

It's funny seeing the line out the door of Franklin Fountain on New Years when Shane's was just a few doors down, quieter, and much more seasonal. So I feel like I have to share the hype.

So far, I've tried:

- The Thomas Jefferson -- By far their thickest, chocolatiest hot chocolate. Like a brownie in a cup. Definitely recommend.

- House Drinking Chocolate -- A lighter drink, imagine a chocolate bar pummeled and melted into hot milk. 

- Royal Spanish -- Still thick with a gently spicy kick. Very good if you like the spice!

- Tuscan Jasmine -- Thick, but with mild floral and citrus notes. Very good!",0.8223251617232035,0.9302325581395348,4.5,5.0

186,KqUinf0QEeiZdxko2dFEsA,Shane Confectionery,"I probably come here once a month and bring all my out of town visitors here. A complete gem. They make bean to bar in this tiny place.

The place has been a candy store since the 1860s and a lot of the inside including the flooring is original! The cash register is a relic, and they still use it! 

I don't Love the truffles. I have only had a few, though. The plain ole chocolate is delicious though. They have different varieties of it from different coffees and they taste completely different. The fudge was very tasty, also. They also have your standard candies that they do not make there, like the citrus gummies and licorice and old timey gum.

The real crown here though is the tiny cafe in the back where you can order hot chocolate and European style sipping chocolates. You can also get cacao tea, which is like the idea of coffee but brewed with the cacao beans instead of coffee beans.

192,bACIZGdHRFfNtrufH0wMbQ,New York Bagel Bakery,"For a few years now, I've wanted to check out this place, even requesting coworkers coming from that direction to bring me bagels.  It's never happened, until I was in Bala Cynwyd early one morning, with an hour to kill.  Yelp told me that they opened at 6:30, but there weren't any hours posted on the door.  I arrived around 6:10 and the place was dark, but there were people inside.  No problem, I have time to kill, so I pop in the headphones and rock out for a bit.  A few minutes later, I noticed the lights come in and a few minutes after that I noticed an open sign.  I walked inside to the heavenly smell of fresh bagels.  I was promptly assisted, but I inquired if any other flavors were coming.  I opted to wait for the egg bagels to finish, but even if I didn't have time to kill, I'm sure I still would have waited for that.  

Once I ordered my baker's dozen of pretty much one of each, I left with the biggest smile on my face.  These things were huge.  Growing up, I was told a tale that the baker's dozen was an extra for the person delivering the food, by my grandfather who was a baker.  He would always tell me that when he was selling baked goods, children would be sent to get the family order and he'd give them their choice to eat on the walk home.  I've since learned that the baker's dozen really comes from medieval times of cheating customers, but this baker's dozen reminded me of my grandfather.  I had to eat on right away in the car, by myself, right away, while it's so hot, no toppings, just gluttony.  No regrets.  This bagel was cheery, tasty, and so puffy.  

Slowly, I became so sad, knowing my wife was going to toast these bagels when we got home.  You're only supposed to toast bad bagels in my opinion.  Wait are there bad bagels?  Sub-par maybe?  She's going to ruin this beautiful texture, because that's how she eats bagels and I have to stop her.  We can toast them tomorrow...

Well, she did want them toasted, but we didn't do that.  They were so good and even the next day they were still better than most, but we did toast them.  Made a nice breakfast sandwich, which was toasty on the outside, but so soft on the inside.  Very happy that I finally made it to this place.",0.7261935415176245,0.7692307692307693,4.5,5.0
193,bACIZGdHRFfNtrufH0wMbQ,New York Bagel Bakery,"My husband went and grabbed a dozen bagels from here while he was waiting for me. The bagels had good flavor, they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were a pretty good size too. I don't know how my husband ate like 5 of them in like a 3 hour period, I ate 2 and was full. 

They just had all the basic flavors. I like getting a couple weird specialty flavors like French toast, pumpkin etc. but they didn't have anything like that here. The most interesting bagel I got here was Cinnamon raisin. I was hoping to at least get a blueberry but they didn't have it. There wasn't much cream cheese selection either. My husband said the options were either plain or strawberry cream cheese, so he got a tub of plain. Unless he was lying to me, cause he hates flavored cream cheese. 

Anyway the bagels were pretty good, but it's a no frills bagel place. My husband really enjoyed it. If we're ever in the area early in the morning again, I'm sure he will want to come by again.",0.7261935415176245,0.7692307692307693,4.5,4.0

The Barista was also very helpful when I was inquiring about there seasonal drink the salted caramal mocha and she said if you don't love sugary drinks I would pass.

254,SUpQ7uFtXvdzgVubewMV8g,Good Karma Cafe,"Go-to cafe for delicious soups and amazing service! Every interaction I've had has been positive so far at this cafe! 

Atmosphere: A few tables scattered around, probably can seat 15-20. Cozy and cute environment. I've seen days where people will simply come to work, other days where it's bubbling with conversation, other days a mix. Great for catching up with friends, dates, or just getting some work done on your own (with their free wifi)! 

Service: Highlight of coming to this cafe - the employees are very kind and friendly! I was super indecisive between soups, and was offered a free sample of one.
 
Food: Their soups will change, but I love their chicken + peanut soup. It was a bit on the oily side, but carried a lot of flavor. When I had a head cold, this really hit the spot! Coffee - they offer almond and soy milk at no additional cost (very rare for a coffee shop), and their special drinks are delicious! The latte I had was a bit diluted though, so I'll stick with their seasonal drinks in the future.

Recommended Must-Try: Sugar plum drink - not too sweet, but delicious blend of vanilla into your coffee! I also have yet to get a soup I haven't liked - quite affordable ($6.50 for 16oz) and flavorful. A tad on the oily side sometimes, but I'm still obsessed. 
 
Overall: 4.5/5 - I love coming to this cafe. It's so versatile and offers a wide range of delicious soups, salads, bagels, coffee, and pastry options. And very affordable! Overall, love the warm experience here (from the food and the service)!",0.7801396600328959,0.8846153846153846,4.0,4.0

they had outdoor seating in the front but the real magic happened when they directed me to outdoor seating in the back. A cozy spot with an amazing environment. Pair that with great coffee and Chai tea, it was a great spot to get some stuff done on a nice day.

267,ZSaKeh2-3U9BiMMqZA0z9Q,Good Karma Cafe,"Good Karma Cafe is one of my all-time favorite cafes in/near University city.

This place is the perfect cozy cafe to get some work done or catch with someone over coffee and I definitely see myself coming back when I'm back in University City and need to grind.

276,ZSaKeh2-3U9BiMMqZA0z9Q,Good Karma Cafe,"I've really been enjoying coming to this lovely sweet spot, friendly cafe with a mellow vibe, relaxed and the soft music plays enjoyable tunes that put me in a good mood, and are at the right volume.  I can easily find myself curling up with a good book, or bringing something relaxing like knitting.  I just wished that they opened closer to 6:30 or 6:45.

I had occasionally been into a few Good Karma's, I always enjoyed them, recently a friend suggested that we meet at another Good Karma.  I really enjoyed it and so I started coming here because this one is literally just up the street from where I live.

I've tried out the London Fog hot teas with steamed soy milk and I really like them.  They look pretty and presentable with the foam, they taste great too.  I would really love it if they offered coconut milk.  I personally prefer 2 tea bags, so I paid an extra .25 for an extra tea bag, totally fine.  I also tried the Honey Chai Tea Latte with almond milk, I was very impressed that the almond milk was lighter than a competitor which was too heavy.  I enjoy these Lattes, they taste great.  A suggestion is to have agave instead of honey.  Also a plus with hot drinks that there were no messy dripping tea bags, a gripe of a competitor.  Extra stars!

What I really like perhaps more than anything else are the many vegan options, vegetarian options too!  Yay!  . I feel that I can make choices which are better for the animals, taste great and don't hurt my wallet.  I've tried some vegan scones, chocolates, the plant milks, and next, I'm eager to try the vegan sandwiches.  Also, they're very clearly marked as to which products are vegan and vegetarian !!

277,ZSaKeh2-3U9BiMMqZA0z9Q,Good Karma Cafe,"If no one else will say it, I will: get your bagels somewhere else!

I won't even comment on the poor quality food. I'll save you from reading about their dry eggs or stale bagels. This place gets the job done (BARELY). I wouldn't make it a regular place unless you frequently begin to starve the minute you step onto Walnut Street. I digress. 

The real ridiculousness of this place pertains to the slow service. I came in before a work meeting to grab a quick bite to eat but should have splurged on the extra few bucks and gone to Starbucks. It took a 20 minute wait in a not-so-busy store to produce a D-grade bagel (see paragraph 2). I was now late for work - old bagel in hand. 

If you have the extra cash on you to spend at Starbucks or Dunkin', go there. NOT worth the frustration.",0.7940012199374346,0.9230769230769232,4.5,1.0
278,ZSaKeh2-3U9BiMMqZA0z9Q,Good Karma Cafe,"This review is going to be so out of line with all the reviews I read in seeking out this joint that I still think it must have been a one off experience 

I will start by saying that my wife and I love coffee and visit coffee shops everywhere we travel. So obsessed, we converted our dining room into a ""coffee  shop"" with four different roasts, sourced from places we visit, in grinders at any one time. 

Unfortunately, my wife and I found both the drinks (iced latte and cappuccino) from Good Karma to be very burnt tasting. We got them to go and actually poured them out a few blocks away. I'd put the drinks close to Starbucks, which I also find a bit dark and bitter. Otherwise, a cute shop with very friendly service.  

I really don't like writing negative reviews but I rely so heavily on reviews to locate local gems that I think all feedback is important. My only regret is that I was unable to talk directly to the shop, which I would have if we sat in.",0.7940012199374346,0.9230769230769232,4.5,2.0

I started with a simple coffee and scone.  The coffee met expectations while the scone was amazing.  No surprise as they are a bakery.  Next trip included a croissant which also far exceeded expectations.  I now look at their specials and order without hesitation!

On the lunch side of things, they offer a selection of sandwiches.  At this point, I've ordered them all.  The Terrace Street is unique, but my favorite is either the Reuben or Cuban.  You get a decent amount of meat and cheese topped on a bread style of your choosing (or their recommendation) along with a bag of chips for less than $10.

317,E6AnAHwEXEWwjbaRw5xyUg,Terrace Street Bakery & Cafe,"Covid-times review: Great place to order breakfast!

Their website has an easy order form (even lets you split the order between multiple credit cards if you're ordering for a group). Lunch selection is very simple - though the lunch sandwiches are good value & solid, I recommend just heading straight for the breakfast sandwiches. Great biscuits, just-right mix of sausage/egg, lots of flavor.

I've been happy with all of the breakfast pastries I've tried so far, but the bacon/chive scones are the BEST. I also really liked their cinnamon almond black tea, which went well with the sweeter pastries.

Curbside pickup service is great - place your order online or over the phone, then when you get to the cafe, call from the sidewalk and they'll bring it out quickly. They're very chill and friendly if you have a dog with you. 

This is a solid spot that I'm definitely going to keep ordering from. Looking forward to post-covid times when I can test out how well they work as a cafe.",0.6895059838339135,0.7777777777777778,4.5,5.0

I ordered a green smoothie (spinach, mango, pineapple..) to kick things off.  Very good option if you dont want one of their fresh juices.  I also liked that none of the flavors were too strong (didn't feel the spinach)

I then order  the beef hash and pancake (the things i do to give you a good review ;) ).

the beef hash had amazing flavor and their homemade ranch dressing is great. 

The pancake would not make me drive here (solid but not wow) but it def complement well if you have something else or are sharing

There are several egg scrambles each with a small twist (Tofu, dill, brie). I had the brie scramble and the cheese wasn't overwhelming and just gave it a nice creamy texture. Mixed in with sausage and onions and it was quite cook. It comes with a dash of hot sauce on it and it was just a perfect amount.

The place is small so if you have a big group make sure to plan according.

A few things to note if you come here for brunch: 
1.) If you're looking for mimosas, they don't serve them here but fear not. If you bring your own champagne they'll set you up with some great freshly squeezed orange juice to go with it.
2.) There are two Ants Pants locations, and they won't seat your party until everyone arrives. Don't be a fool like me and let your friends go to the wrong one.

Nice selection of items here both from the breakfast and lunch menus. Service is very caring and they seem to know the menu pretty well. Coffee selection is pretty good, although cold brew is on the intense side, even for cold brew.

Probably my favorite breakfast place now (well except for Hungry Pigeon, which isn't REALLY a breakfast place) near Center City, given the worsening in quality at Honey's and the change in the menu over time at Green Eggs, removing most lighter options from their menu.

BYOB, fresh juice, Aussie specialty coffees and treats, unique menu specials, and mouth-watering food? I mean - what's not to love?

I knew I'd like this place from the second I walked in. It's bright, clean, and crisply decorated, like straight from a trendy a Instagram account. Obviously, this is not the most important factor in choosing a brunch spot, but first impressions are pretty important! Before I moved to Australia for a year, I had no idea the country was known for their coffee, but I have missed it every day since I've left. There's just something unreal about their brews. Fortunately, you can get a taste right here in Philly! Not a coffee drinker? No worries - indulge in one of their freshly squeeze juices or delectable milkshakes (with flavors like TIM TAM!)

For food, we ordered a French toast for the table, and I purchased the sweet potato and Italian sausage hash. Everything was fresh, hot, and flavorful. The sweet potato hash was unreal. I couldn't stop eating it. Had I any self-control, I probably could have leftovers. The French toast for the table was the perfect idea - it was good, though not the best I've ever had, and very sweet. Too much to eat as a full entrée alone, but sharing allowed us all to have a piece. 

We arrived with a party of four, and only waited about 15 minutes. The place is small, but they utilize space wisely. I'd advice against coming here with more than 4 people, however. While not impossible, it would be trickier to seat. Street parking is available all over the surrounding areas, some metered, some free - just pay attention to the signs.

I hadn't been in a TeaDo in a couple years until I stepped into this location last night. I was excited to see my old favorites on the menu and see some new ones as well. Service was friendly, but I was disappointed with the drinks.

I got my usual, the sesame milk bubble tea. I decreased the sugar to 30%. The sweetness level was perfect, and the flavor was just okay. However, there were many undercooked bubbles and the overall flavor had a fake sweetener taste. The bubbles were also smaller than most shops, but not the mini ones. 

My husband had the Thai tea which used to be my backup drink. They asked him if he wanted to adjust the sweetness level of this drink, which surprised me. At the other location I used to visit, they could not adjust the Thai tea since it was not a powder and the base was brewed in advance. When he received the drink, I tasted it, and it didn't have the same flavor as the one TeaDo used to brew. It was rather bland. Maybe they're using a powder now? I'm not sure, but it was very disappointing. It's a shame because they used to have the best Thai tea out of all the bubble tea chains.

395,t2vxEpIP8ntB4OBHrNAcVw,Tiffany's Bakery,"WOW ... where do I start! ... I wanted to order a custom Baby Shower cake. Perused their site, didn't like anything. I choose a design from the web. Nowhere on their site could I find how to place my order. I called Tiffany's ... for a custom design I would have to have a consultation in store.  Located in NE Phila I went to the suburban store. I talked with Dylan and told him I had called about placing a custom baby shower cake and was told I needed an in-store consultation. He said he didn't know what I was talking about, that I could order online using email & proceeded to give me a business card. He said to put all information in the email together with a picture of the cake and a designer would get back with cost.  Needless to say this trip was a waste of my day, time & money. Once home I sent off an email with my web image stating I wanted it exactly like the image, same colors but remove baby shoes on top tier. I  stated pound cake/lemon filling and the new baby's name. Gave details of  date/time/restaurant & 30 guests.  Went so far as to state the obvious,  cake should arrive early. Simple and straight forward ... so I thought! DAY of BABY SHOWER ...  the restaurant (is in town) arrived approximately 50 mins early to set up. Everything was ready but no cake. Guests were arriving ... 15 mins in, no cake ... 25 mins in, no cake ... then my daughter called & driver told her he's stuck in traffic. He was over 1/2 hr late.  When he took the cake out the first thing I noticed is the baby's name was smeared. After the cake was cut, I realized this was not a pound cake but a sponge cake. I have pictures showing the texture of sponge cake. The image I used was a baby shower cake that was very soft, petite & dainty looking. What I received was a poor representation if you want to call it that. Everything was over sized and looked poorly put together. I ordered a cake to feed 30 people. After the restaurant cut the cake there was at least more than 50% left over. WHY???? I called the Monday after the shower and spoke with Dylan, GM, regarding my disappointment in what they describe them themselves as a World-Renowned Bakery and the lack of quality of a $398.00 cake plus an additional $28.00 delivery fee to a location that is only a few blocks away. I wish I could post a pictures. I told Dylan this was a sponge cake not pound cake (he insisted it was pound cake) ... NO, it was not! That's the FIRST LIE. I stated the cake was over 1/2 hr late and the driver told us he was stuck in traffic. Dylan said his driver arrived and was told by the hosted that no one from our party was there yet. SECOND LIE. I told him  of my disappointment with the lack of soft, cute, daintiness this cake should have had as for a baby. I specifically brought his attention to a bow at the base of the top tier. The bow is suppose to be small and feminine as it accented what is a top of a dress and a waistline & then the bottom of the dress. The bow on the dress from the bakery took up the entire width of the top tier cake where as it should have only been about 2-1/2"" at most. I asked Dylan why so large. He told me all designers are unique in their style. I didn't want to hear that because I asked for exact as the picture I sent. Dylan proceeded to tell me the bow could not be made a different size because they're made out of ""gum paste"" and purchased from elsewhere. I was puzzled about that & asked if they order them in all different colors so as to have what the customer needs. Dylan told me they spray them to the color needed. I asked him how does the color go all the way through and he said it does. Well, I researched and found out that ""gum paste"" is hard and brittle not soft like fondant. The bow was large and frumpy, because it was made from ""fondant"". Dylan's THIRD LIE. A $398 cake for 30 people equals $13.27/slice with over 50 left over cake ??? something's not right! To Sum Up: Expensive cake, Over sized cake, Over 1/2 hr late & no call, No Consultation was needed (wasted day), Sponge cake (not pound cake), Smeared baby's name, poor representation of design (very large details, not baby like) together with Dylan's multiple lies. All this and all he offered was my delivery charge returned. I fought him and he then offered delivery fee and $50. I asked him to break down my costs so I could understand the $398 charge, he wouldn't. I called their other store and got basic charges for approximately the same cake ... a custom 10"" and 7"" fondant two tier, three layer cake with similar design for $240. That's a huge difference in price and would like to know why. I think my cake was thrown together last minute and that's why it was late and looked so poorly put together. World-Renowned ... I don't think so. Never again and please beware if you're looking for quality.",0.5428234559432086,0.5833333333333334,3.5,1.0

I even tried the red velvet strawberry shortcake. It is excellent! The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the customer service is less than stellar. The last time I went I was the only person waiting and there were several people working but chatting amongst themselves . I stood for a while before someone noticed/addressed me. Then I was made to get a ticket but I was the only one waiting. The young lady milled around more before she asked me what my number was and then said she would be servicing my number . It was odd. While I was there an older woman walked up and said she wanted to order cannolis . She interrupted the woman helping me to help the older woman who was very anxious to get cannolis. This action raised an eyebrow because I was confused why someone else couldn't have helped the older lady. But because she was older I gave her a pass but there should have been another way to deal with this type of thing. When it was time to ring me up the young lady who helped was so preoccupied with her conversation she could barely calculate my order. It was very unprofessional. She apologized a few times but it was still very awkward.

Unfortunately, being eager to dive into the sweet treats, I didn't get a good picture of any.

Customers are directed to take a number and then wait for your turn to order. It gets kind of crowded in front of the small counter area as this means there is no orderly line-- kind of like the area in front of the supermarket deli counter. The staff members were efficient.

How sweet it is to buy cakes from you...

I needed a cake made with carrots... and there you were.
I needed some icing, and Happy Birthday... and there you were.
With sweet filling... my emotions.
For this cake.. I'd cross the ocean...
I wanna STOP and thank you Tiffany
I've gotta STOP - thank you Tiffany, yes indeed...

How sweet it is to buy cakes from YOU! (X2)

I cut that cake one night
People asked how they lived without it in their lives!
Every single bit, and I wanted more
How had I not tried this cake before?
And you brighten up the Fashion District all of the ways
With some sweets and treats for all kinds of days
I wanna STOP and thank you Tiffany
I've gotta STOP - thank you Tiffany, yes indeed...

This little gem under the Fashion District has taken the struggle out of buying a cake for friends on a time-crunch. I needed something for a large birthday dinner, and was struggling to grab something that wouldn't break the bank. $29 for a cake that fed the entire party was AMAZING! and everyone admitted, the carrot cake was one of the best they'd ever tried. 

It took a little while to find, and service was a bit slower than ideal, but there were a lot of kids around (mostly buying sodas) and maybe that stressed out the staff. Great experience - I'd go back!",0.5428234559432086,0.5833333333333334,3.5,4.0

I send photos of cakes found online for them to draw some ideas ( beware they only email at the end of business). I received a response a day later with prices for the cakes in the photos not the #7 cake requested which means they were not actually paying attention to the emails. I was quoted $800!  This bakery is not worth the aggravation. After almost a week of emailing I still have no quoted price for the cake I actually requested now I'm stuck trying to find a new bakery.

It's not some orgasm-in-your mouth pastry or breakfast sandwich that you cannot get anywhere else.  But, what they do are damn good cakes, cupcakes, danishes, eclairs, etc but it's such a frustrating and miserable process, it's hard to really want to go to Tiffany's if another bakery is nearby.

Pros:

Cakes and cupcakes really are delicious.  They won't blow you away, but they're quality, moist, and traditional.  Pastries and breakfast items are also not bad.

Breakfast items and coffee are properly priced and fairly for the area.

The cake ordering is easy and convenient and the cakes are delicious.  

Cons:

It's a premium bakery with premium prices.  4.99 large cupcakes, more expensive cake slices.

Service is really hit or miss.  Sometimes it's rude and difficult and other times it's pleasant and comfortable.  It's rarely fast.  It's often rude.

The ticket machine at the counter at the new one in the Gallery *ahem* Fashion District isn't prominent, but the cashiers are devoted to only using it even as people meander up to the counter.

Selection is often limited for a bakery.  

Conclusion:  It's a quick and easy stop for baked good and breakfasts that works for nearby offices.  That's what Tiffany's is - a decent place to get a cake for an office birthday or event and maybe a decent breakfast item.",0.5428234559432086,0.5833333333333334,3.5,3.0

La Colombe really makes one of my favorirte iced lattes and most of the time, each location is consistent!  For the pastries, went with a beignet & chocolate croissant the first day, then a cinnamon danish.  Not sure where the pastries are from, but all are very good and make for great snack.

I personally like very sweet coffee and so adding the liquid sugar is a must for me. This place is very traditional on the sense that they don't have any flavors to add like how at Starbucks you can get vanilla, Caramel, etc. I personally would not come here to get work done as it is pretty loud, but it would be nice to come here and chat with friends and people watch from the windows!",0.7498042157718113,0.8571428571428571,4.0,4.0

We have come here several times when in downtown, especially to warm up during Mummer's parades and Christmas Village shopping, and have never been disappointed. I also love that they serve you with real spoons (and real mugs) and explain to you the coffee if you are not familiar. The whole vibe in there is very chill and not rushing you out like a Dunkin or Starbucks.

446,6wqxuBt2InDipRuUj8BNuQ,La Colombe Coffee,"I really enjoyed La Colombe draft lattes in the can so I had been wanting to come here for awhile to taste it for myself. I don't know what I was expecting before arriving but I certainly don't think it was the experience I had. First off the place isn't that big but the front counter area is massive. There's minimal seating and it's all very low and small - a table for 2 rather than larger tables. Most of the tables were taken so I'm assuming it's a pretty popular spot. I didn't know what I wanted and I realized there was no menu on the wall. How do I order then? I've never been here before. I finally see a black card about as big as a 5x7 notecard that had about 10 items listed on it and I was able to order that way. The staff than placed a spoon and a plate in front of me and I just waited not sure if I was supposed to wait there or move to the side ... then a plastic cup was placed in front of me. Why a plastic cup when I was sitting in? Why a plastic cup when I was given a regular plate and a regular spoon. Nonetheless I sat down I found one seat available. The coffee was good but different. I do love their draft lattes they're so smooth and delicious but I got mine with oat milk because I was excited for the option, but it definitely hindered the flavor I'm used to. 
The staff, which there seemed to be a lot of, wasn't super friendly. They didn't talk to patrons, they seemed almost bothered or bored. One guest spilled his entire coffee and the one woman behind the counter just seemed pissed off. 
I also don't like the bathroom location because here really isn't anywhere to wait for it as it's so close to the counter and other tables and I had two people cut in front of me to use it. 
I think this space isn't efficiently designed and I was a little lost while there. I don't like going to places where I question every decision. Do I leave my cup and plate on the table? Do I bring it to the counter? Certain things weren't clear or obvious so I feel like they should be explained because not everyone inherently knows or is a regular that knows.",0.7498042157718113,0.8571428571428571,4.0,3.0

They also have a wide variety of pastries and breakfast options for those looking to grab a bite to eat, and it's always very fresh!

The seating is just uncomfortable enough to warrant a short stay (i.e. tiny tables that are bolted into the floor preventing you from moving it close to you, bench seating that is awkwardly high unless you have long legs or are over 5'8""). A huge issue for me is that they also don't have WiFi which I only found out after purchasing my $5 latte, hunkering down with my laptop to get some work done, asking a barista for the WiFi password after being plainly told ""no"" they don't have WiFi. Fair enough. I get that they get a ton of customers but there are far more inviting (and useful) coffee shops in the city with better brews (Elixr, Rival Bros, and Ultimo to name a few).

463,6wqxuBt2InDipRuUj8BNuQ,La Colombe Coffee,"For the past week, I have been coming here more often rather than a competitor's coffee chain.  I have found that I not only crave my freshly brewed Corsica, but that it actually tastes like good coffee!  It doesn't upset my stomach but it gives me the perk that I need to get going.  I had been frequently going to a competitor with bitter coffee, or the alternatives were other cheap coffee or way overpriced coffee at other places.  Corsica has become my sweet spot!  It's nice that I usually don't need more than a cup, if I do, I get a refill for .75, but just so you know, they have a $1 minimum.  As far as other beverages, I like the herbal Turmeric Iced Tea, which is really good.  I have friends who rave about the Black and Tan, and the Iced Chai.  

I also have found that I really enjoy the Chobani yogurt to start my day with, or if I want a pastry, these pastries are the bomb!  I am personally a fan of the scrumptious chocolate chip muffin, but it's big enough for 2 portions, fun to split with someone.

The ambiance here is relaxed and chill, friendly baristas, low volume music, which is very nice for a change compared to other coffee shops that seem like dance clubs with the loud music, lol!  The tables and chairs are nice to relax at, I often bring my paper or knitting.  They do have outdoor seating and they overlook Dilworth Park.

It's a location that's either swamped with tourists or business people during lunch hours. Once I was studying for GREs on a weekday from 9AM- 7 PM and it was busy the entire time. I think that says a lot. 

Pros: the coffee beans are seriously just the best of the best. I always say that they're much better than Starbucks. I just bought the Lyon beans home and my mom loves it. My go to is usually the oat milk latte. Try oat milk people it's naturally sweet so you don't have to add too much cane sugar. Also if you're not a fan of sweets like me then I go for the  almond milk latte. They have a plethora of pastries to go along with your coffee or tea. 

The only con I have is no WiFi. I guess la Colombe wants their shops to be conversation- friendly and not a place to surf the web/ do work so I usually come here when I don't need WiFi (reading a book or writing a paper without any research material). I wrote my GRE admissions paper here lol

482,McQZweV9DLoNzbJWksPJ6w,Pilgrim Roasters,"Pilgrim Roasters is a new business located on Manayunk's beautiful Main Street. Just opened fora  short time, Pilgrim Roasters will wow your taste buds and everyone -- from coffee snob to coffee virgin alike!

It is great to see a new business in Manayunk. It just reminds me that we never stop changing as people. Life goes on no matter how much we may want it to slow down or even stop. 

I know the feeling as I have recently come to a crossroads.

My son Bryan was in jail. 

It was just a few years ago when I finalized my divorce with Cynthia, the mother of my twin sons Bradley-and-Bryan (B'n'B). The boys took the divorce hard, especially as I moved to Montclair, New Jersey to settle in with my new wife, Tonya M. I made sure I spent time with B-N-B at least once a month. But time and geography made us unfortunately grow apart.

A few days ago, my ex-wife Cynthia called me. Bryan was arrested by SEPTA police and charged with illegally impersonating a train conductor. He is facing many harsh charges as a result of his actions.

I moved to Montclair to start over and to help my wife Tonya M. (an ex-felon who committed voter fraud) rebuild her life. But starting over sadly means you leave others behind.

I blame me. It is my fault my twin son decided to impersonate a regional rail employee. 

I have to be there for my sons.

I am moving back to Manayunk.

I am moving back home.

Pilgrim Roasters is a great place to enjoy coffee while your ex-wife breaks the news about your son's arrest and you feel overwhelmingly guilty for failing as a father, like you always feared.",0.8069067805102377,0.8787878787878788,4.5,5.0

544,SLWYIXWq2hAJAErn_icdXw,Factory Donuts,"These are good, or even great for what they are, but many won't want what they are, myself included.  The trend lately (Federal Donuts for example) is to make the SAME donut over and over and just change the toppings or glazing. I suppose this is easier both with equipment and time in not having to make different dough recipes. I like having the taste and consistency choices of a cruller, or a Boston cream, or dozens of other types with different consistencies.  By all means, if the topping flavor change on the same donut is what you're looking for, knock yourself out and have a good time, but I'll head over to Holmesburg Bakery in the same neighborhood and grab an overstuffed cream donut.",0.7830556363184401,0.851063829787234,4.5,3.0

As I was waiting I looked around the shop and it was very clean. When I got my donuts and went to my car a tried the lemon meringue donut first and it was delicious. I love the fact that they are warm and fresh. The rest of the donuts that I picked out were very good too but if your not going to eat them all within 2 days don't order a whole dozen. You can microwave them for a few seconds if you want to but when they are fresh from the store they are at their best. I would definitely go here again!,0.7830556363184401,0.851063829787234,4.5,5.0

Loved the customer service  not sure the cashiers name she was lightskin and tall slim built she seemed really nice. She helped a lot in our indecisiveness on what donuts to pick for a dozen. 

The sausage egg and cheese croissant was fresh, hot and yummy. By the looks at first I was like not sure because the egg kinda reminded me of the eggs they keep in the fridge at dunking donuts. The croissant itself was different too I thought it was a donut at first because of the shape. It was honestly one of the best sausage, egg and cheese croissants I've ever had and so filling...could hardly even eat the donuts after had no more space lol 

The iced coffee with Irish cream and sugar was really good I enjoyed and could tell it was pretty good coffee they used not the watered down version. 

My favorite part was seeing them make the donuts from scratch then adding the toppings this was a cool experience because it's rare to ever see them make fresh donuts specially for your order. 

I would highly suggest this spot the cashier/ donut maker as well as the woman with the glasses who made our sandwiches were very pleasant and you could tell care about making sure the service and food is served with love.

You didn't even have to buy a half to get a half; you just had to take the time to go to the store and get them which is what I did this morning.

The store is bright and clean and has very friendly staff. An additional plus is they have off-street parking.

The donuts are made to order. The staff keep the machine churning out the donuts for the amount ordered, and once they are out of the fryer, they are each weighed for quality control. If they are not within parameters they are tossed out. Good ones are placed in a box and sent over to the creation makers. Our flavors today were Glazed, Blueberry Bake, Chocolate Covered Strawberry, S'Mores, French Toast, Cookies N' Cream, Strawberry Factory, Vanilla Factory, Maple Explosion, and Strawberry Lemonade. They have several other options, and now you can also get cream.

When we got home, we went to town and thoroughly enjoyed what we could. Many were just too sweet for the adults, but the kids loved theirs. I'll see if they taste even better tomorrow.

$12.99 per dozen made before your eyes. We got two free due to the promotion.

583,UQLWfOGTF-7T2EQlUT92Zg,Lost Bread Co.,"I'm actually really sad to give them a one star, because I was really excited to support local business. I tried a few loaves of theirs from the winterfare market. Everyone raves about their bread, I love bread. I thought it'd be a slam dunk. I tried their pumpernickel with apple crisp bottom and their traditional white bread. The traditional was comparable to Italian bread, they told me, but was really more of a sourdough flavor. It was tough and chewy. The pumpernickel, while it sounded great, was inedible. It was the strangest, mealy, flavorless loaf. Maybe it was a one off thing and I got a bad batch, but I don't see what all the hype is about. Almost $10 per loaf and I straight up threw them away after one slice bc it was so bad.

I've since been to their Howard street location twice during this pandemic for in-store pickups.  If I've learned one thing about how we handle being at home, it's that the entire world decided to bake bread.  It was weeks before I saw flour on sale in the grocery stores or the standard flour I buy.  I think early on, I couldn't find meat either, but I found corned beef packets after St. Patrick's day.  I wanted Rye bread, didn't know if I would be able to find it, so I went to Lost Bread to get some Rye Flour.  A whole wheat too, pretzel short breads, and their pizza kits.  The pizza kits were perfect for the two of us and they had a sliding scale to purchase more dough.  Very helpful to people not currently getting a paycheck, but still wanted to eat a decent meal.  

I've been back for more Pretzel Shortbreads for me and others, (you're welcome Mom for the Mother's Day gift...  It beat's any candy for someone who grew up in Philadelphia)  I've also gotten more pizza kits for the summer greens featuring ramps and cheese curds.  If it wasn't for the COVID-19, I wouldn't have been frequenting this place as much.

I grabbed that and a pack of pretzel shortbread and was on my way.

The bread is to die for. The loaf is perfectly crispy and the inside is flavorful and airy. I ate two slices without anything on it and it was delicious. Excited to try more of the variations, but I can tell this one is going to be a favorite.

They utilize local ingredients and farms, and they make extremely great flour so my first batches of bread came out pretty decently. I ran out of flour, so I put in an order last week to pick up today. At the end of last week I was diagnosed with Covid-19, so there goes any public outings. I emailed Lost Bread with that information and my order number, and today they dropped off my flour with some bonus ""Stuck in the House Emergency Cookies"" and I died from the thoughtfulness.

We have been in Philly just over two years and I have to say that Lost Bread is one of my favorite places to support. Delicious bread - and numerous types and all are amazing. The pretzel shortbreads are also to die for. 

They also are a pickup location for Proyecto Tamale - and for the past three weeks, it's become our Sunday ritual taking the walk up there, get some flour (for home bread making) and pastel de nata (if you haven't tried these you are missing out), perhaps some Blind Tiger Coffee beans if we need them, and pickup the tamales. 

In the nicer months, they also were at the Christ Church Farmer's Market in Old City which made it a tad easier to snag some goods. But the location near Fishtown isn't hard to get either (for a no car family like us that walks everywhere).

This little bread company is located in a really innocuous part of town as well as on the street. With the door closed I'm sure I wouldn't think anything of this warehouse-looking neighborhood bakeshop.

I tried all the pastries they had that day, my friend got a hominy biscuit, and we split a half loaf of milkbread and a loaf of the seeded bread.

The donut was a little bit on the dense/chewy side. Filling was good and didn't ooze as one may fear. Dough of the donut was sweet and light. Filling wasn't overly sweet or overpowering of the dough.

Pear Canelle was crisp on the outside and soft and moist on the inside; good variation in texture without any overpowering flavors. A great standard canelle.

Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie was the first thing I broke into (long time readers will understand). Very moist and flavorful, good consistency throughout, distribution of chips and overall flavor was good.

Kouign-aman was a slightly different shape and texture than I was accustomed to. Not sure if this was intentional or if it was a mess-up that got called a kouign-aman. Overall it was a good pastry.

623,h_rcMQtglIiAs-Oc5d8Ozw,Old City Coffee,"I don't like writing negative reviews, especially of independent businesses trying to compete against corporate giants.  That said, a negative experience at Old City Coffee in the Reading Terminal Market has compelled me to write such a review.  

I live in Florida and have visited the Philadelphia twice a year since 2007.  Before every visit, I look forward to a trip to the Reading Terminal Market to get a DiNic's brisket and an Old City Coffee.  The coffee part, I'm sad to say, is not going to happen anymore.  As the reader of this review, of course you have the right to think my review is whiny complaining about something inconsequential, or it may make some difference to you.

That said, I think the next statement is patently obvious and should be a universal of human decency - one should never make fun of people with a disability.  And while I'm sure the barista at Old City Coffee would disagree with my characterization, it's my observation of the events that make fun of me is exactly what he did.  

I've been a heavy consumer of coffee for decades, and in all my experiences, I've never even close been treated as rudely as I was by and Old City Coffee barista.  I have hearing loss.  It was crowded in the market and I was having trouble hearing what the barista was asking of me.  After the second time of asking him to repeat himself, his answer was in a tone of great exasperation, as if my hearing problem showed that I was the world's least intelligent person who was wasting his time, Then he answered my question at a volume that was too loud for even my compromised hearing.  All this said in front of my family; not only was this embarrassing, but it reminded me too of something that's been quite worrisome, since my livelihood depends upon hearing what people say.

I wrote an email to their website, and received a very nice response from someone who I later found out was the founder of the company.  I greatly appreciate this, however it's simply not enough to repair the extremely bad feelings I have consequent to this experience.

In the same position, I would've offered to send someone a bag of complimentary coffee, or a mug, or something.  Perhaps this is beyond their capabilities due to the expense, but if this is the case, then OCC certainly can't afford to employ such rude baristas.

And in all honesty, $16.00 for a pound of coffee is even more steep than what the corporate behemoth Starbucks charges for an equivalent bag of beans.  If you're more expensive than Starbucks, you'd better provide an A+ cup of coffee and experience of the servers.  Both were quite below this.

It's really too bad, because I used to look forward to Old City Coffee, and their caffeine molecule t-shirts is one of my favorites.  Now, all I can think of is that barista speaking to me more like a middle school bully rather than someone there to provide a good experience.  

So, while I appreciate at least the email of apologize, I'm still done with Old City Coffee.",0.7306594331951245,0.8260869565217391,3.5,2.0

So, whenever I have the opportunity to try a new coffee place I get very excited. Since I was in the reading terminal I knew this place had to be good to maintain a spot in the infamous food market. Therefore, when I ordered I used my go-to tactic. I asked the worker what his favorite hot latte was. He then told me the most popular was vanilla and his favorite was maple. I believe coffee is an art. I like it in its most natural form but I also am willing to experiment with different accent flavors. Reassuring the maple wouldn't be too sweet I decided to trust this man. Since he suggested the maple and vanilla hot latte I of course got both. Before they put the lid on I could see the signature foam creation hot lattes usually come with. I appreciate the craftsmanship even if there is going to be a lid on it. In addition, I would like to highlight my first sip of this coffee. It was the perfect ration between steamed milk and espresso. Even more importantly, the latte was hot! The perfect temperature. I find with a lot of places hot lattes are not prepared hot enough, but this one was perfect. I would 110% recommend the maple flavored hot latte. It had an undertone of maple flavor without being too sweet. The vanilla flavor was also tasteful. If you want coffee made with love I would tell you to go here. Very reasonable prices for crafted coffee.",0.7306594331951245,0.8260869565217391,3.5,5.0
626,h_rcMQtglIiAs-Oc5d8Ozw,Old City Coffee,"The younger woman here with dark hair who helped me was literally one of the nicest customer service experiences I can recall. 

I was inquiring into one of their ceramic bee house pour over drip coffee things that you set above a cup and brew coffee with, and she explained the whole thing and how it worked. Nerd Diatribe: I actually have been interested in Bee House products ever since America's Test Kitchen named their salt cellar best salt cellar in their Kitchen testing. Don't SMH too hard here... we need you to make it through the rest of the review. 

She answered every single one of my random questions about brewing pour overs. I mean... who better to tell me. Someone who does like 100 pour overs a day. 

She let me know that she actually had the same pour over Bee House thing I was inquiring about. 

She told me about which filters to use. She taught me how to fold the filter to get it fit right. She told me about pouring hot water over the filter with no coffee in it to get the paper taste off the filter. She told me about the bloom of the coffee. 

So I come home... and do exactly what she says. And guess what? I make the best pour over coffee I've ever made. I've been messing up pour over coffee for at least like 3 months now. 

I mean... she taught me right. 

Give a man a pour over cup of coffee and he'll write 1 Yelp review. But TEACH a man to make a pour over cup of coffee and he'll write 8 reviews in the span of 2 hours.

I will definitely stop by here the next time I'm in Redding Terminal. I can't wait to tell her how much she helped me. I know what you're saying. You're like ""This poor girl doesn't care about your coffee making Mike B."" No seriously, she's that awesome, I like truly believe she does.

'Are you at the one at the back?  I'm at the one at the front!'

'Ooooooh'

And that conversation with my better half was when I realized there were two locations of old city coffee within the popular Reading terminal.

So having two locations is convenient for sure, but what did I think of the coffee itself?

Not bad!

Old City has nice strong coffee and a series of freshly roasted coffees going as tame as french roast, to as interesting as the Sumatra Takengon blend.

I got their Old City blend, which was strong, and a nice cup.  

There are no booths or seating at either location for old city, but as mentioned earlier, being inside of reading terminal means there's a large amount of community seats and tables that you can sit and enjoy your cup. 

Speaking of cup enjoyment...I don't know that I would stand in the long lines that I both saw and stood in again for the cup of coffee I selected, but if i'm in the area, need a cup and lines are manageable, sure i'd stop in!

I ordered an avocado toast and cold brew. The avo toast was on rye bread, and it was exactly what I wanted. Sliced avocado, pickled red onions, snappy little capers, and sea salt, topped off with a drizzle of olive oil, on the best damn rye bread I've ever had. Each bite was just scrumptious. It took some willpower to not devour the toast in three bites, 'cause I was starving. The cold brew coffee was good and strong.

A customer ordered a slice of their legendary babka while I was noshing and I instantly knew I had to try it. This babka was on point and gave me life. Crusty, buttery and flaky, with soft, delicious layers of heaven on the inside. I wound up grabbing a slice for my sis, too. Not eating it on the way home was a struggle, but I somehow managed.

Only the way out did I realize Essen carries bagels, despite the large bagel menu to the right of the counter and the numerous cups of cream cheese up front. I can't wait to come back here and try them.

668,s30pUay0opzvriFweACWEA,Essen Bakery,"500th review and I'm happy it's Essen. Very cool place and amazingly hospitable staff. It's very small in terms of seating, so that's a minus, but one reason it's small is because of the bakery space it has. It appears like many (all?) of the items are made on sight. I got to see a baker prepare a cinnamon hazelnut babka for its overnight fermentation. Awesome.

I had a smoked whitefish bagel sandwich and it was excellent. Pickled onions are the best choice here, but the harsh raw variety that most bagel shops provide. The best thing about Essen is their bagels are baked well and untoasted. A bagel's crust is where the crispiness comes from, not its crumb. Wanna toast a bagel? Toast the whole thing. 

But it lacked some chew. Maybe some more assertiveness in the kneading or a higher gluten flour (consider pitching vital wheat gluten). But the bagels tenderness actually made for a fairly bitable sandwich.

Chocolate babka was great. After watching the process, I confess it's exactly how I would make it. Does that mean it's right? I dunno, but it means I like it.

I'm coming back. Essen is a great place.",0.8035899319996437,0.9166666666666666,5.0,4.0

I had heard great things about Essen bakery, so when I walked by it, I had to stop by and try. Essen still has covid protocol in place so all orders are placed at a window and there are a few tables outdoors.

I ordered a babka slice and a chocolate chip cookie. The babka was really good and tasted very fresh. The cookie was huge and had a sprinkling of sea salt which added a unique flavor to it. 

The service was great, the person who took my order was friendly and recommended their favorites. 

Few things to know:
-If you desire you can place an order online at Essenbakeryonline.com and pick up in person
-Masks are required 
-Hours are limited from Wed to Sun from 8:30-3PM so plan accordingly

There was quiet music playing overhead and the whole ambience was very cozy. We ended up splitting a chocolate babka and sweet cream cheese babka.  The sweet cream cheese babka was pretty good, but the chocolate babka was nothing short of amazing- chocolatey without being overly sweet, with soft, chewy light layers. The slices ($3) were more than generous, but we actually ended up getting a third slice of the chocolate variety since it was so delicious. Paired with my rooibos tea, the combination was a hit.
